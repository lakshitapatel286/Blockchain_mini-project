# Blockchain_mini-project
Simple Blockchain Simulation with Digital Signatures
This project is a simple Python implementation of a blockchain. It demonstrates the core concepts of blockchain technology, including:
<br>
-Block creation
<br>
-SHA-256 hashing
<br>
-Linking blocks using previous hash
<br>
-Digital signatures for transaction authenticity verification
