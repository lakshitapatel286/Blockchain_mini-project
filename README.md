# Mini Blockchain with Digital Signatures 

A simple Python-based blockchain built for educational purposes.
This project  include functions for creating new blocks, calculating SHA-256 hashes, and linking blocks. Include a feature that uses digital signatures to verify the authenticity of a transaction within a block.

🚀 Features

✔ Create new blocks

✔ SHA-256 hashing

✔ Linking blocks to form a chain

✔ RSA digital signatures

✔ Signature verification before adding a block

✔ Check blockchain validity

✔ Beginner-friendly Python code

🧱 How It Works

🔐 1. Digital Signatures

- Every transaction is signed using a private key

- The blockchain verifies the signature using the matching public key

- If signature is invalid → ❌ block is rejected

- Ensures authenticity & security


⛓ 2. Blocks

Each block contains:

- Index

- Previous block’s hash

- Transaction

- RSA signature

- Timestamp

- Current block hash

🪢 3. Blockchain

- Starts with a Genesis Block

- New blocks are added only when signature is valid

- Chain integrity is checked by recalculating hashes

---
 📌 Example Output

✔ Block added successfully!

Blockchain valid? True

{'index': 1, 'transaction': 'Alice pays Bob 10 coins', ...}

🔧 Files Explained

1. block.py
- Defines the block structure and SHA-256 hashing.
  
2. blockchain.py :
Handles:
- creating genesis block
- verifying signatures
- adding new blocks
-validating the chain

3. digital_signature.py

Creates RSA keys:
- Sign transaction with private key
- Verify using public key

4. main.py
Runs the whole blockchain:

- Generates keys
- Creates transaction
- Signs it
- Adds block
- Displays entire chain
